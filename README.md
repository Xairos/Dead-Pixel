## Disclaimer

This was a project developed for a grade 11 computer science class. As such, the design and programming are representative of three students learning python and game programming. The main reason behind making this project available is to show a development in our skills. That being said, enjoy!

## About the Game

Dead Pixel is a 2d platformer developed by us here at Compound 1080 Studios. Our goal was to develop a game that is both artistic in feel, and solid in its mechanics. To develop, we used using Python 3 with Pygame libraries.

~~We are currently in our early Alpha stage, so expect some bugs. However, you are completely free to test drive our game so far! Just scroll down to the Quick Start section below.~~

We've released the game! Scroll down to the Quick Start section below to try it out.

You can follow our development in further detail by following us on Twitter, send us a shout [@Compound_1080](http://twitter.com/compound_1080).


## Quick Start


To quickly get started, follow the steps below:

* [Download the latest release](https://github.com/Xairos/Dead-Pixel/tree/master/current) along with the dependency folder(s)
* Grab the latest Python version, or in our case, [Python 3.3](http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.1/)
* Install the appropriate [Pygame](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads) version
* Read the Known Issues section before playing

## Known Issues

Certain sections of the game were unable to be completed due to time constraints. Some common bugs/missing features are:

* On the main screen, a save file **must be selected before starting the game.** Neglecting to do so will cause a crash.
* The main screen does not restrict left or right movement, leading to infinite screens in both directions.
* Joystick/Controller support is limited and unreliable.
* Certain doors on the first level do not lead to an interior, and will cause a crash.
